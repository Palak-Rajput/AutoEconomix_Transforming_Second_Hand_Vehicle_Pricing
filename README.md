## Introduction

The Car Price Predictor project combines machine learning with web development to create a platform where users can predict car prices based on selected criteria. This project utilizes a trained regression model to provide accurate predictions.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project include:

1. **Prediction Accuracy:** Develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting car prices.
2. **User Interface:** Create a user-friendly interface for users to input car details and receive price predictions.
3. **Integration:** Integrate the machine learning model into a web application for easy access and usability.

## Problem Statement

To design and implement a web application that incorporates a trained machine learning model to predict car prices based on parameters such as company, model, year of purchase, fuel type, and kilometers driven.

## Features

The Car Price Predictor offers the following features:

1. **Selection Options:** Users can select the company, model, year of purchase, fuel type, and kilometers driven.
2. **Prediction:** Upon submission, the application predicts the price of the selected car based on the input parameters.
3. **Dynamic Updates:** The predicted price is dynamically updated on the web page without requiring a page reload.
4. **User-friendly Interface:** The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use for all users.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Development

- **HTML:** Used for structuring the web page.
- **CSS:** Employed for styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented for frontend interactivity and dynamic behavior.
- **Bootstrap:** Utilized for responsive design and frontend components.

### Backend Development

- **Flask:** Utilized as the backend framework for handling requests and responses.
- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and processing.
- **Scikit-learn:** Employed for implementing the machine learning model.
- **Pickle:** Utilized for model persistence.
